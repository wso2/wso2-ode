14.4.?Correlation

After a correlation set is initiated, the values of the properties for a correlation set must be identical for all the messages in all the operations that carry the correlation set and occur within the corresponding scope until its completion. If at execution time this constraint is violated, the standard fault bpws:correlationViolation MUST be thrown by a compliant implementation. The same fault MUST be thrown if an activity with the initiate attribute set to no attempts to use a correlation set that has not been previously initiated.

This process is intended to FAIL by attempting to use a non-initialized correlation set.
